# Callup — build roadmap

Feature slices in build order. Each is a **walking skeleton**: wired end-to-end and
testable in the browser before the next one starts, then deepened later. The pipeline
this builds toward: fetch & normalize job postings → match bench candidates → generate
truthful tailored documents → assist applications → draft hiring-manager outreach.

Status: ⬜ not started · ▶ in progress · ✅ done

| # | Slice | Delivers (testable on screen) | Status |
|---|-------|-------------------------------|--------|
| 0 | DB schema v1 | 10 base tables live in Supabase | ✅ |
| 1 | Auth + recruiter/org bootstrap | Email login → first sign-in establishes your identity | ✅ |
| 2 | Onboarding + dashboard | First sign-in → onboarding (create org, become owner) → dashboard showing org + your role | ✅ |
| 3 | Team invitations & roles | Owner/admin invite recruiters/admins via shareable link; members management + role-gated permissions | ✅ |
| 4 | Candidate intake | Create / list / view candidates with the full profile (education, experience, certs, projects) | ▶ |
| 5 | Candidate documents | Upload candidate files to Supabase Storage; list them on the candidate | ⬜ |
| 6 | Job postings (manual) | Create / list / view job postings by hand, incl. hiring-side contact | ⬜ |
| 7 | Job ingestion (Dice) | Autonomous worker fetches + normalizes + dedupes Dice postings into the same job list | ⬜ |
| 8 | Matching | Embeddings + similarity + LLM re-rank; ranked candidate↔job matches surfaced in the UI | ⬜ |
| 9 | Document generation | Truthful tailored resume / cover letter, validated against verified candidate facts | ⬜ |
| 10 | Applications | Create application records against a job, track status, application dashboard | ⬜ |
| 11 | Assisted apply session | Playwright worker + live SSE session with the mandatory human-approve-submit step | ⬜ |
| 12 | Outreach | Draft hiring-manager emails (Gmail); sending gated by `OUTREACH_SEND_ENABLED` | ⬜ |

## Notes on ordering

- **Auth + org/team (1–3)** come before candidates so every later row has a real
  recruiter/org and a team to own it.
- **Onboarding (2) before team management (3):** prove explicit org creation + the
  dashboard, then layer invites and roles onto it.
- **Manual job postings (6) before Dice ingestion (7):** prove the job model + UI by
  hand, then make the worker just another writer into the same tables.
- **Matching (8) needs candidates + jobs (4, 6/7)** to have anything to rank.
- **Generation (9) before applications (10):** an application attaches a generated,
  fact-checked resume.
- **Assisted apply (11)** is the most complex (browser worker + SSE + human-in-loop);
  it comes after the documents it submits exist.
- **Outreach (12)** last; send stays behind the `OUTREACH_SEND_ENABLED` gate.

Each slice gets its own design spec under `docs/superpowers/specs/` and an
implementation plan before code. Deferred schema pieces (pgvector embeddings, Dice
ingestion fields, fitment scores, normalized contacts, apply-session state machine,
separate outreach record) land as migrations when their slice arrives — see
[`database-schema-v1.md`](./database-schema-v1.md).

## Slice 4 progress (candidate intake — built in chunks)

Slice 4 is large, so it ships as chunks with their own plans under
[`docs/superpowers/plans/`](./superpowers/plans/); the design + full chunk roadmap is in
[`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-25-candidates-feature-design.md`](./superpowers/specs/2026-06-25-candidates-feature-design.md).

- ✅ **Chunk 1 — foundation:** `candidate.title` + `candidate.primary_skills` columns (migration
  `12c80bf0e060`), `candidateStatus` util, shared `AppLayout`, `/candidates` route.
- ✅ **Chunk 2 — roster read:** role-scoped `GET /candidates` + the filterable roster (status
  tabs, search, recruiter grouping, list/grid). Filtering is client-side (see follow-up below).
- ✅ **Chunk 2.5 — shared-types pipeline:** `@callup/shared-types` generated from a committed
  `backend/openapi.json` via `openapi-typescript`, with two-sided drift checks.
- ✅ **Chunk 3 — quick-view drawer + status change:** RBAC-guarded `PATCH /candidates/:id` and the
  card → drawer → optimistic status change; "Open full profile" → `/candidates/:id`.
- ✅ **Chunk 4 — full profile view:** RBAC-guarded `GET /candidates/:id` (candidate + experience/
  education/projects/certifications, scoped via the shared `_ensure_access` helper) and the read-only
  `/candidates/:id` profile page (breadcrumb, section nav, header reusing the Chunk-3 status changer,
  composed sections, documents placeholder).
- ⬜ Chunk 5 — add wizard (create); Chunk 6 — profile edit + reassignment; later chunks per the spec.

## Follow-ups (tech debt, not slice-blocking)

Carried out of completed slices; fold into a later slice when convenient.

- **Integration test transaction-rollback fixture.** DB integration tests (e.g.
  `create_owned_org`) currently create rows in the live Supabase DB and clean up in
  a `finally` block — a failed assertion mid-test can orphan rows (it did once, leaving
  a circular-FK'd org+recruiter that had to be deleted by hand). Add a shared
  session-fixture that runs each integration test inside a transaction and rolls back,
  so nothing ever persists. When it lands, also restore the stronger idempotency
  assertion (`second.name == "Jane"`) dropped in slice 2. (From slice 1/2.)
- **Onboarding/profile sign-out robustness.** In `frontend/src/lib/profile.tsx`, set
  `loading:false` directly on the 401 branch (don't rely on the session-null effect),
  and handle a `signOut()` rejection so a failed sign-out can't strand the user on the
  retry screen with a stale session. (Slice 2.)
- ~~**Cold-load deep-link bounce.** Cold-loading any protected deep link
  (`/candidates/:id`, `/candidates`, `/`, `/accept-invite`) bounced to the dashboard and
  lost the URL.~~ **FIXED (commit `d1138cb`, found during chunk 4 smoke test.)** Root cause:
  `ProfileProvider` acted on the transiently-null session during Supabase's cold-load
  session restore, flipping `loading→false`, so `RequireOnboarded` redirected to
  `/onboarding` (then on to `/`) before the `/me` fetch even started. Fix gates the
  profile-load effect on `auth.loading` so it waits for the initial auth resolution
  instead of reacting to the transient null. Related to the profile-robustness item
  above. (Slice 4 — Candidates chunk 4 smoke test.)
- **201 happy-path route test for `POST /orgs`** with a fake session that returns the
  org on backfill (success path is currently only covered via the `create_owned_org`
  integration test). (Slice 2.)
- **Frontend 401 handling.** `ProfileProvider` now signs out on a 401 from `/me`
  (slice 2). Still pending: make this *global* in the `api` client so any 401 from any
  endpoint redirects to `/login`, not just the profile fetch. (Slice 1/2.)
- **Repository unit-of-work.** Move the `commit()` out of `create_owned_org` to the
  request boundary once a route performs multiple writes. (Slice 1/2.)
- ~~**Generate `packages/shared-types`** from the backend OpenAPI schema instead of
  hand-declaring response types on the frontend.~~ **DONE in Candidates Chunk 2.5** — pnpm
  workspace + `openapi-typescript` generating `@callup/shared-types` from a committed
  `backend/openapi.json`, with two-sided drift checks (backend pytest + frontend CI) and all
  hand-declared backend shapes (`CandidateCard`, `Member`, invitation types, `User`, `Me`)
  migrated. (Slice 1 → Slice 4 chunk 2.5.)
- **Shared-types drift loop assumes both CI workflows stay un-path-filtered.** The
  backend→`openapi.json`→`openapi.d.ts` drift loop is airtight *only because* neither
  `backend-ci.yml` nor `frontend-ci.yml` is path-filtered, so every PR runs both guards. Both
  files note a possible future "path-filter upgrade." If `frontend-ci.yml` is ever filtered to
  `frontend/**`, a backend-only PR that regenerates `backend/openapi.json` would skip the
  frontend drift step and let a stale `openapi.d.ts` merge. If that upgrade is made, the
  frontend workflow's trigger paths MUST also include `backend/openapi.json`. (Slice 4 chunk 2.5.)
- **Harden the conftest `.env` mini-parser** (quoted values / inline comments) if the
  backend `.env` ever needs them. (Slice 1.)
- **Partial unique index on invitations.** Add `unique(org_id, email) WHERE status =
  'pending'` in a migration so "one pending invite per email per org" and the
  concurrent-accept guard are enforced at the DB, not just in application logic. Today
  `create_invitation` revokes-then-inserts (a benign TOCTOU under concurrency) and the
  accept race is handled by catching `IntegrityError` → 409. (Slice 3.)
- **CORS-on-500 surfacing.** Unhandled exceptions return a 500 without CORS headers, so the
  browser sees a misleading "Failed to fetch" instead of the real status — this masked the
  remove-member FK bug during slice-3 testing. Apply CORS headers to error responses (an
  exception handler / middleware) so 500s reach the SPA as real errors. The FK fix removed
  *this* slice's 500, but the masking remains for the next one. (Slice 3 hardening.)
- **Orphaned auth-account reconciliation.** Remove-member and delete-org delete the
  Supabase auth user best-effort: the DB rows are deleted first (transactional) and a failed
  Auth Admin delete is logged, not retried — so a network/5xx blip can leave an orphaned
  `auth.users` row. No reconciliation/cleanup job exists. (Slice 3 hardening.)
- **Profile-less auth users from abandoned signup.** `signUp` creates the `auth.users`
  row immediately (email confirmations off), but a `users` row only lands on onboarding
  (`POST /orgs`) or invite accept — so abandoning onboarding leaves an auth user with no
  profile. The onboarding screen now offers an explicit **Sign out** link, so this is a
  supported exit, not just a back-button accident — which makes profile-less accounts a
  normal, one-click outcome. It stays *recoverable*, not a dead-end: `Login.onSubmit` falls
  back to sign-in when signup reports the email already exists, letting the user resume. We
  deliberately do **not** sweep these accounts (they're harmless — `get_current_user` 403s
  everything but `/me`, `POST /orgs`, and invite-accept). Add a cleanup sweep only if they
  accumulate. (Slice 3 hardening.)
- **Unique token hashes in the member-repo integration test.**
  `tests/db/test_members_repo.py` seeds invitations with hardcoded token-hash strings
  (`"th-accept"`, `"th-sent"`); the `invitation.token_hash` unique constraint means parallel
  integration runs against the shared DB would collide. Use `uuid4().hex`. (Slice 3 hardening.)
- **Drawer can show a stale candidate after a roster refetch.** In `Candidates.tsx`, the
  quick-view drawer's `selected` candidate is a snapshot. If the roster's `useEffect` refetches
  and repopulates `candidates` while the drawer is open (e.g. an `isManager` flip or remount),
  `selected` isn't reconciled against the new array, so the open drawer could show pre-refetch
  data. Reconcile `selected` against the refreshed list (or re-fetch the single candidate) when
  the full profile fetch lands. **Still open** — chunk 4 was read-only and didn't touch the
  drawer, so this wasn't addressed there; fold into a later chunk that reworks the roster/drawer
  (e.g. chunk 6 edit, or server-side filtering below). (Slice 4 — Candidates chunk 3.)
- **Server-side candidate filtering + pagination.** The candidates roster (Candidates
  chunk 2) returns the full role-scoped bench and does status/search/recruiter filtering,
  counts, and grouping **client-side** — fine for small benches but doesn't scale (whole-org
  payload, no pagination). Move those filters server-side as `GET /candidates` query params
  and add pagination once benches grow. Authorization/scoping is already server-side; this
  is a perf/scale change, not security. (Slice 4 — Candidates chunk 2.)
